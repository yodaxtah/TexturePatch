Image in [Texture Patch](./Texture%20Patch/) are created using Canva ([here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGMOYNR6Dc/lMR9P2Lz57AsJVdaHav2NQ/edit?referrer=icons-landing-page)).

Subtracting a few resulted in the current logo.

```console
$ python main.py diff ./canva/Texture\ Patch/5.png ./canva/Texture\ Patch/6.png ./canva/testc.png
(-255, 255)
$ python main.py diff ./canva/Texture\ Patch/4.png ./canva/Texture\ Patch/6.png ./canva/testc.png
(-255, 255)
```

Using GIMP, the color white was made transparent, and the canvas' height was halved.
